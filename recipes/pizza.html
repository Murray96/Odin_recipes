        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl.<br>

        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite toppings</li>
        <li>Top crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
